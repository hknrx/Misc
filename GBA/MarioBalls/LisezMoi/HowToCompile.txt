Instructions to recompile the project:
-------------------------------------

1) Install VisualHAM (available from http://www.console-dev.de); Mario Balls has been successfully
   tested with version 2.5.

2) Uncompress the source package somewhere on your hard disk. The archive contains:
   - The sources (under the directory named "Sources"),
   - All the graphic resources as bitmap files (under "Graphismes").

3) Load the project into VisualHAM by double-clicking on the file named "MarioBalls.vhw".

4) Compile: press the F6 key.

Notes:
-----

a) All bitmap files will automatically be converted at compilation time using "gfx2gba"; the
   generated C files will then be compiled. It is normal these operations take quite a lot of time,
   so be patient and do not worry if nothing happens during a minute.

b) To avoid regeneration/recompilation of graphic resources every time you compile, modify the
   makefile:
   - Line 225: change "gfx_:" in "gfx:",
   - Line 227: change "gfx:" in "gfx_:".

   And same for the sounds:
   - Line 279: change "sfx_:" in "sfx:",
   - Line 281: change "sfx:" in "sfx_:".

c) I recommend updating your version of VHAM to the latest available; in particular you should
   upgrade to the "v2.5 A Beta" which fixes a problem with absolute/relative paths (thx to Peter
   for the advice!).
