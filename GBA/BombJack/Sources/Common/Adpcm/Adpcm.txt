The IMA-ADPCM algorithm takes a word (16 bits), and produces a nibble (4 bits), which is then placed
sequentially into a buffer for later storage. This has several important advantages. For one thing,
it means that while the uncompressed data is endian dependent (being either big-endian or
little-endian), the resulting compressed data is endian-independent, which is a big plus when making
a cross-platform sound standard.

ADPCM stands for Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation. ADPCM is a lossy compression
mechanism. There are various flavors of ADPCM. This particular algorithm was suggested by the
International Multimedia Association (IMA). IMA ADPCM compresses data recorded at various sampling
rates. Sound is encoded as a succession of 4-bit or 3-bit data packets. Each data packet represents
the difference between the current sampled signal value and the previous value.

The International Multimedia Association (IMA) flavor of ADPCM compresses 16-bit data to
4-bits/sample (4:1) using a different (faster) method than Microsoft ADPCM, and has different
distortion characteristics, which can produce either better or worse results, depending on the
sample being compressed. As with Microsoft ADPCM, it’s best to save to this format from 16-bit
rather than from 8-bit. This compression scheme can be a good alternative to MPEG; it provides
reasonably fast decoding of 4:1 compression, and it degrades sample quality only slightly.

IMA-ADPCM is the most suited codec when CPU resources are already used by video and when audio is
more an additional than a primary feature. It’s a low cost solution for simple audio compression
that requires low CPU load. IMA-ADPCM is independent of sound type (not a speech or psychoacoustic
codec).
